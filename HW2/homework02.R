# Stat133: HW 2
# Description: This assignment has 3 main purposes:
#       - working with data frames, vectors and factors
#       - practice basic manipulation of data structures
#       - creation of simple graphics
#
# Data: Camping Tents
# =====================================================


# Please submit your own R script file to bcourses


# Write your name

# =====================================================
# Reading the Data Into R
# =====================================================
# We'll be working with the dataset 'tents1.csv'
# (available in the folder 'datasets' in the 
# github repository of the course)
# =====================================================


# Read the file 'tents1.csv' in R and assign it to an object
# called 'tents' ---this will be the main data frame--- 
# Character strings must NOT be converted to factors!
# (use whatever method you like to import the data)


# inspect the data structure of 'tents'


# check the class of the object 'tents'


# how many rows in the dataset?


# how many columns in the dataset?


# names of columns


# take a look at the first 5 rows


# take a look at the last 3 rows




# =====================================================
# Quantitative Variables:
# =====================================================
# We'll start by exploring the quantitative variables
# 1) price
# 2) weight
# 3) height
# =====================================================


# get numeric summaries of each quantitative variable


# instead of using the summary() function, find functions
# that allow you to get the same results for 'price'
# - minimum value
# - first quartile (i.e. 25th percentile)
# - median value (i.e. 50th percentile)
# - mean value
# - third quartile (i.e. 75th percentile)
# - maximum value


# weight is given in grams;
# add a new variable 'weight_lbs' to 'tents' for weight in pounds


# height is given in centimeters;
# add a new variable 'height_in' to 'tents' for height in inches


# how many tents have a price greater than $400


# how many tents have a price less than or equal to $300


# how many tents have a price between $300 and $400
# (including both $300 and $400 prices)




# what's the name of the tent with maximum price


# what's the name of the tent with minimum price


# what's the name of the tent with maximum weight


# what's the name of the tent with minimum weight


# select the data of tents with 
# price > $400 AND weight < 1500 grams




# calculate the 90th percentile for height and 
# assign it to the object 'height_p90'


# calculate the 90th percentile for weight and 
# assign it to the object 'weight_p90'


# select the data of tents with 
# height > height_p90 AND weight > weight_p90




# obtain a new data frame called 'rei' containing
# the data of those tents with brand 'rei';
# and inspect its dimension




# Use the cut() function to create a factor 'price_cut' from 
# all the tent prices;
# for the argument 'breaks' give a vector of cutting points
# such that the obtained levels are as follows:
#    (0, 100]
#  (100, 200]
#  (200, 300]
#  (300, 400]
#  (400, 500]
#  (500, 600]
#  (600, 700]


# use table() to check the obtained frequencies of 'price_cut'




# Use cut() to create a factor 'weight_cut' by using the
# breaking points and labels according to the following table:
# ----------------------
#     intervals | labels
# --------------|-------
#     (0, 1000] |  1kg
#  (1000, 2000] |  2kg
#  (2000, 3000] |  3kg
#  (3000, 4000] |  4kg
#  (4000, 5000] |  5kg
#  (5000, 6000] |  6kg
#  (6000, 7000] |  7kg
#  (7000, 8000] |  8kg
#  (8000, 9000] |  9kg
# ----------------------


# verify that the frequencies given by table(weight_cut) are:
# 1kg 2kg 3kg 4kg 5kg 6kg 7kg 8kg 9kg 
#   3  24  30   7   7   2   9   3   3 




# =====================================================
# Statistical graphics of Quantitative Variables
# =====================================================
# for each quantitative variable, obtain the following plots:
# - histogram
# - boxplot
# - density curve
# (look at each graphic carefully and see what types 
# of distribution patterns show each variable)
# =====================================================










# Obtain scatter plots of:
# price, height
# price, weight
# height, weight




# Obtain a scatter plot matrix of price, height, and weight




# =====================================================
# Plot challenge: 
# Here's a small graphic challenge; you'll need to 
# read the documentation of plot() and par()
# =====================================================
# Obtain a scatter plot of weight and height such that:
# - Axis are labeled with the corresponding variable name
# - Points are colored with alpha transparency
#   (choose a color of your preference)
# - The symbol of points are filled triangles
# - x-axis ranges from 0 to 10000
# - y-axis ranges from 80 to 220
# - Include a title






# =====================================================
# Qualitative Variables
# =====================================================
# Now let's focus on the qualitative variables:
# 1) brand
# 2) bestuse
# 3) seasons
# 4) capacity
# =====================================================


# get frequency tables of each qualitative variable


# what is the brand with less number of tents


# are there any tents of brand 'rei'?
# and if so, how many?


# are there any tents of brand 'mountain-hardwear'
# and if so, how many?


# how many 'rei' tents are intended to be
# used ('bestuse') for Mountaineering


# what unique brands have tents intended to be used for 'Mountaineering'




# =====================================================
# Statistical graphics of Qualitative Variables
# =====================================================
# for 'bestuse', 'seasons', and 'capacity' obtain 
# the following plots:
# - bar plot
# - dot chart
# - pie chart
# (feel free to change colors, add titles, and rank values)
# =====================================================










# =====================================================
# Plot challenge: 
# =====================================================
# Make a barplot for 'brand' such that:
# - bars are horizontally oriented
# - bars are arranged in decreasing order
# - bars without a border
# - brand labels are perpendicular to the y-axis
#   (i.e. labels horizontally oriented)
# - modify margins in order to have enough room for labels 
# - x-axis ranges from 0 to 25
# - include a title








# =====================================================
# More basic manipulations
# =====================================================


# summary of 'price' of big-agnes tents


# summary of 'price' of rei tents


# cross-table of seasons and bestuse






# =====================================================
# Bivariate Plots
# =====================================================


# use boxplot() to plot the distribution of 'weight' 
# conditional to:
# - brand
# - bestuse
# - capacity
# - seasons
# (get a boxplot for each categorical variable)




# make a scatter-plot of height and weight, using 
# 'capacity' as a factor for the color argument


# get the same scatter plot but now pass 'bestuse'
# as a factor for the color argument


# remember that factors are internally stored as
# integer vectors. To get the integers associated to the 
# levels of a factor you can use unclass(). For instance:


# make the same scatter plot, using 'bestuse' as factor for colors,
# and using the integers associated to factor 'bestuse' for the
# argument that changes the type of plotted symbol






# =====================================================
# Plot challenge: 
# =====================================================


# obtain a new data frame called 'big_agnes'
# by subsetting tents of brand 'big-agnes'


# create a vector of colors for big-agnes tents according to 'bestuse':
# 'Carcamping' tents in color 'tomato'
# 'Backpacking' tents in color 'orange'


# Make a scatter plot of 'weight' and 'height' (of 'big-agnes' tents)
# The background of the entire plot must be of color 'gray95'
# Instead of points, show the name of each big-agnes tent
# Use the vector of colors to color tent names
# Include a legend in the bottom-right corner indicating the 
# 'bestuse' types and their corresponding colors
# Add a title

\frametitle{XPath in "XML"}

\bb{XPath in \code{"XML"}}
To work with XPath expressions using the \code{"XML"} package, we have the auxiliary function {\hilit \code{getNodeSet()}} that accepts XPath expressions in order to
select node-sets. Its main usage is:
\begin{verbatim}
    getNodeSet(doc, path)
\end{verbatim}
\eb

where {\hilit \code{doc}} is an object of class \code{"XMLInternalDocument"} and {\hilit \code{path}} is a string giving the XPath expression to be evaluated
